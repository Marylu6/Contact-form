# Contact-form
using chatgpt (since no one answer me in any forums) will try to make a contact form using JS and bootstraps
1.unexpected error message from github pages is "There was an error sending your message. Please try again later." didnt specify where is the error will try to see is it is the PHP. Also learn a bit of PHP since i dont understand it well

2. error 405 on the console .......The 405 error code you are receiving when submitting the contact form indicates that the HTTP method used in the request (in this case, POST) is not allowed by the server.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37761926/does-github-pages-allow-http-post-method so gotta find another place to test this
